This is a Roleplay server, please RP any instance that you can out, if it is something that can not be handled in the city or should be brought to the attention of an admin/dev, we reserve the right to close any ticket that we feel can be handled in the city.\
The server is a Serious Roleplay Server however, you may see things in this server that you are not used to seeing in other Serious Roleplay Servers. This is because we keep content creation in mind. We also try to maintain roleplay over rule play. We are all here to have fun but don't be afraid to lose items, chases, gunfights, etc.

## Rules
### Characters
- You are not allowed to transfer money/items from one character of yours to another character of yours.
- Separate your characters; enemies, friends and locations known on one character shouldn’t be known on another character.
- You can not identify people by their voice if their face is covered by a mask.
- The only PED models allowed to be used are the freemode male/female models. There are other peds available but they may only be used by those who are whitelisted to the model. Use of any model besides freemode or one you are whitelisted to will result in a ban. 
- You are allowed only ONE gang / organization character.

### Prohibited RP
- Suicide RP and Sexual Assault RP are prohibited, Vigilantism is subject to approval by admins before proceeding.
- As a worker of any emergency service ( PD, EMS, FD ETC) you may not sell any weapons or equipment from the armory. (Unless you get approval of corruption from staff)

### New Life Rule (NLR)
- If you are intentionally downed and ocean dumped or left in a remote area, you forget ALL EVENTS leading up to your death and lose any RP reason to seek revenge. (This includes the last 30 minutes before your death.)
- If you are taken to the hospital and are revived there, you can remember all events leading up to your death. This does include Ocean Dumping and Leaving in a Remote area if found.
- Once a player gets downed, they cannot come back onto a scene
- You cannot decide when another person permanently kills their own character, these decisions are made OOC and agreed upon before the attempt. You may plan out a scenario for perma’ing a character.
- The only EXCEPTION to this rule is if you have signed a blood-in/blood-out contract with a gang then your life is forfeit if they so choose. If the gang chooses to enforce this option then they will need to raise a ticket and present evidence to support this decision. If a valid case with supporting evidence is presented that warrants permaing a character then the contract will be enforced. This is not to encourage permaing others characters for minor grievances/misunderstandings/etc. Permanent death should only be used as a last resort when warranted by the roleplay.
- RP your injuries. During active situations, you should RP your injuries even after getting revived by Pillbox for at least 5 minutes.


### Metagaming
- Using information that your character did not find out in game which includes streams, discord channels, or anything used to enhance your roleplay. This also includes information between different characters.
- After you die, you cannot talk about your death through in-character channels unless someone informs you through RP.
- Use of any third-party platforms (to include, not limited to, Discord, Skype, Twitch. YouTube, Kick, Gilded, ETC) for communication is prohibited.
- Any use of powers (tx/admin panels) to influence a roleplay situation is **STRICTLY** prohibited. All power usage is logged and only viewable by the server owners.

### Powergaming
- Attempting to use roleplay as an excuse for abusing non-existent game mechanics to gain an advantage within roleplay (i.e: not properly identifying your wounds, unrealistic use of /seat, or using handcuffs without compliance)
- You should not be selling drugs while in a car or on a bike. There is a reason that you may not start selling from inside of a vehicle. You must be on foot while selling.
- /e sitchair into a building is considered powergaming! So remember dont power game!
- Use of various emotes while in vehicles comes with a strict set of limitations. Violation of these limits will result in punishment up to being banned. These limits are as follows:
- Driving while in an emote that conceals your character in a vehicle is **STRICTLY** forbidden. This is grounds for immediate punishment.
- Shooting while in an emote that conceals your character in a vehicle is **STRICTLY** forbidden. This is grounds for immediate punishment.
- Passengers may utilize emotes that conceal their character in a vehicle while the vehicle is in motion but the above limits still apply.
- Drift and Drag cars are not allowed for use during heists. They are only to be used in races.

### Random Deathmatch (RDM)
- Killing another player(s) without any roleplay reason or an attempt to roleplay. You must initiate before killing someone and can’t just kill someone without the intent to roleplay. This is mainly left to admins discretion.
- Please utilize your judgment skills when it comes to initiating gunfights near server restarts. This generally means don’t go killing someone for the purposes of roleplay in the last 10 minutes leading up to restart. Failure to follow this guideline is considered RDM and will be handled accordingly.

### Vehicle DeathMatch (VDM)
- Killing or attempting to injure another player(s) with a vehicle without any intent to roleplay is not allowed. 
- If somebody holds a gun to you while you are in a vehicle that is turned on, you can drive away / run them over as your intention of escape and nothing further.
- You should treat your vehicle as if you actually owned it.
- You should not be ramming other players or using your car as a weapon. You wouldn’t realistically use your vehicle as a weapon. (admin discretion) 

### Cop Baiting
- Attempting to bait police into arresting you or pulling you over. You should not put yourself into cop scenes if you are not involved without reason. Being bored is not a reason. (Do not just randomly shoot in an area to ambush police. This excludes cops pulling up to gang on gang beef or war.)

### Fail RP
- Where this rule can be quite broad, it will apply to any action that is either unrealistic or failure to roleplay. An example here would be attempting to pass items through glass.
- At no time may anyone escape prison, or assist someone in escaping prison, using a helicopter. This rule is also encompassed with FailRP as there would be prison guards who would shoot down the helicopter IRL.

### Fear RP
- Fear roleplay is the concept of role-playing fear for your character’s life in situations where your attacker is able to quickly end your life at will. This can come in the form of having a weapon aimed at your character's head at close range, where reaching for your own weapon would result in you being killed instantly, or where your life is in direct danger and any attempt to resist would result in your immediate death.

### Breaking Character
- You should not break character at **ANY** time in the city.
- Using terms you would use in real life, such as referring to someone's voice as “microphone”
- Remember to **FINISH** any situation where a rule break occurs and report it afterwards.
- Your characters should never know about each other unless someone tells you about them, or finds out about them in the city. Such as a cop reading a report, or someone telling you about something that they did.
- Staff is not to be referred to in the city under any circumstances, nor should bans, rule breaks, or anything similar related to staff duties. There is a ticket system in place for those affairs.
- Reports of any kind (bug, staff, support, etc) made in- character to any member of the staff or development team will result in an immediate ban. It completely ruins the immersion our team is having and we will have zero tolerance for this behavior. For example: “ I wish the gods would fix (insert problem here)”.

- Be realistic with your robberies and plan your hostages (minimum of 1), make sure that you have enough hostages for all of your demands, or time. Understand that due to time, Police can breach the building, if you do not have enough hostages to trade for time.

###  Robbing other Players
- Players are allowed to rob other players by either roleplaying it or by forcing them to raise their hands.

### Low Effort Roleplay

- Going AFK while doing a job will not be tolerated unless its an **EMERGENCY**

**EXAMPLE**: You are engaged in a gang war and are the only gang member in city. The opposing gang has 4 members in city. You decide to hire private security for your protection. You may hire up to 5 so you have a total of 6 while the opposing gang can only hire up to 2 to bring their total to 6.\
In the event that you are defending your gang turf with the assistance of private security you can only hire up to the limit of 10 and if additional gang members fly in then the private security will need to disengage and retreat from the scene.\
It is the responsibility of the private security force to ensure compliance with engagement limits. It is understood there may be moments where limits are exceeded for brief interactions but it should be minimized and if it is a problem please submit a ticket with video evidence.

### Kill On Sight (KOS)
- KOS is against the rules unless during Events, Gang Wars/Gang Beef, someone is removing a gang spray.

### Rules For Gang Wars
- Gang wars should only be initiated by the leaders of the gang within the city. The terms of the war will be mutually agreed upon by both gang leaders and will serve as the rules for the conflict. It's important to ensure that you adhere to all these rules.
- Gang Wars are limited to what gangs agree upon
- Once a shootout occurs the  gang that started it are on a 15 minute shootout cooldown, Once the enemy gang retaliates they are also on a 15 minute cooldown. Applies to beef as well. (This will be **HEAVILY ENFORCED**.)
- After agreeing to the terms in the city, you must post the terms for Beef/War in [gang chat](https://discord.com/channels/1150636897098543115/1197292368852951211), this is a requirement for gang leaders to post here.
- Minimum term list below:
    - Is this beef going to be KOS? 
    - What has happened RP wise to build this gang war? 
    - Who is fighting in the Gang War? 
    - Leaders of the gangs? 
    - All other terms discussed and agreed upon.

### More information on Gang wars
- There needs to be an actual RP build up to have a gang war
- KOS on turfs is ALLOWED
- KOS is also something that needs to be established with the leaders during the gang war meeting. **IF THIS IS NOT ESTABLISHED IN WAR TERMS, STAFF WILL REACH OUT AND ADDRESS THE SITUATION**.
- It is HIGHLY recommended and encouraged that if KOS for a gang war is an agreement that a ticket is logged with approval from both gang leaders. Either one can initiate the ticket and @/ping the other gang leader and each may provide their approval for the war and the terms. This is to prevent confusion and he said/she said issues.
- While in gang war, you must rep your color at all times, unless doing criminal activities such as heists.  Some members do not have to participate in shootouts and or war but have to  anticipate being shot at or taken hostage. 
- When going down in a situation, you must wait 15 minutes before injecting yourself into any criminal situation. If taking medical. (**GLOBAL FOR COPS AND CRIMS IN ANY SORT OF SHOOTOUT.**)
- When you are pushing a rival gang on their turf, both sides are allowed the full member count of their gang. ← Example A gang with 10 members pushes a gang with 10 members, it would become a 10v10.
- Example: If a 5 man group pushes the 10 man group on their turf, ALL 10 will be able to attack back. You will no longer be locked to only 5 defending your turf. If an opposing gang feels brave enough to push another gang turf, they must face the wraith.
- Anything OUTSIDE of the turf will remain a 6v6. (However if a gang is hanging out together and you try to press them then they can respond with everyone in that situation.)
- You may return to your turf after for example being shot at alta, although if you do return the 6v6 becomes the whole gang against the whole gang.
- You are not allowed to ally with anyone outside of your gang to attack a different gang, unless you have hired a mercenary group through RP. (Merryweather Security)

### Closing
- All rules are subject to be changed at any time without due notice.
- Ban length is dependent on previous bans/warnings and the severity of the rules broken.
