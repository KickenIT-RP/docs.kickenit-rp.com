# KickenIT Roleplay Gangs

Below is information regarding the various whitelisted gangs in KickenIT Roleplay. These gangs have all completed a whitelist application which is located at the bottom of this form in order to be approved for whitelisting and to receive official in-city support such as gang management, gang stashes, gang specific vehicles and weapons, and a gang specific resource.

Whitelisted Gangs are supposed to be held to a higher standard and should always focus on roleplay before gun play. Always attempt to roleplay out situations such as hostage taking before shooting the other side. Such as at meetings, trades, etc.

## Applying for Gang Whitelist

As stated above whitelist gangs are held to a higher standard, and must provide valuable RP before submitting an application, so please answer the following questions and open a [ticket](https://discord.com/channels/1150636897098543115/1157860672185577473) with the information (the gang leader must submit the ticket)

### Requirements
- Minimum of two (2) original (OG) members that have been around for more than thirty (30) days in the city.
- The gang has to be around in a non-whitelist status for more than thirty (30) days before a whitelist application may be approved.
- All whitelist gang applications must be approved by majority vote from the admin team, meaning the more information you give us, the better the chance you have at getting approved.
- You **MUST** provide three (3) clips proving that you provide valuable RP. These clips must show that your Gang is RP'ing with other members of the server, not just your own gang.
- None of your gang members should have any strikes/warnings or they must be minimal.

### Questions to be answered in support ticket
- What is the name of your gang?
- Who is the leader(s) of the Gang?
- Who are the original gangsters (OGs)?
- Who are the members in your gang?
- Is your gang Blood In/Out?
- What gang specific resource would you like have (not guaraunteed)?
- Do you confirm that at any point, KickenIT Roleplay admins reserve the right to disband a gang/organization if we feel that it is not fit for the community?
- Please provide at least 3 clips proving that you have provided valuable RP. If you do not provide clips, your application will be denied. If you are having trouble recording clips (PC issues etc. please mention this in your ticket and we will work with you to see how to get documentation of your gang's rp)

Once you have completed the above questionnaire please open a ticket in the support channel with the answers and the admin team will be in contact.
